This is the official *Vipps Payment for Wix*. More than 4 million Norwegians use Vipps. Give them a fast and familiar shopping experience in Wix, too!

This plugin provides a direct integration with Wix. Now, you can let your customers choose Vipps directly in the checkout.

You can also do important back office tasks such as capture and refund directly from Wix. Easy for your customer, and easy for you.

## Vipps Payment

When you enable this plugin, your customers will be able to choose Vipps as a payment method directly in the checkout. There is no need to go via a third party payment method. If your customer choose Vipps, the customer fills in their contact information and is then asked to enter their phone number in the Vipps dialogue. Then, the customer confirms the payment in the Vipps app. The order is completed and are stored in your Wix store.

## Vipps Express Checkout

Vipps does not yet have a solution for express checkout in Wix.

## Vipps Recurring Payments

## Important notes

It is not possible to capture an order from within Wix Admin. You will need to use the Vipps MobilePay [Merchant Portal](https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com) to do the captures on each order. This is very important, because, if you forget to capture the orders, you wonâ€™t get the payment.

This is due to limitations in Wix and lack of support for making the necessary API calls to Vipps. We are simply not able to automate this or make it possible to do captures directly in Wix.

Norwegian law is strict: Is it not legal to do the capture before the goods are sent or provided to the customer. This is different in other countries, and because of this there is limited support for the Norwegian reserve and capture requirements.

We are aware that this is not the most optimal solution for merchants, but this is a restriction which we canâ€™t go around for now. We will of course optimize this as soon as it is possible.

Learn more about [the difference between reserve and capture](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/reserve-and-capture/#what-is-the-difference-between-reserve-capture-and-direct-capture).
