# Vipps for Wix order management

In the Vipps MobilePay [Merchant Portal](https://portal.vippsmobilepay.com/), administrators will get information regarding sale units, transactions, reports, statistics and portal users.

The portal requires a user to have a valid Norwegian BankID, which is the most used electronic identification solution in Norway and a Norwegian mobile number.
